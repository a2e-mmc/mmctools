# mmctools
A repository for mesoscale-to-microscale coupling (MMC) preprocessing,
postprocessing, and analysis tools

See the `dev` branch for the latest code under development. 


## Overview

These tools are intended to:
1. Enable offline-coupled mesoscale-to-microscale simulation between a variety
   of mesoscale and microscale solvers
2. Standardize output from simulations in addition to observational data
3. Facilitate the analysis, assessment, and reporting of MMC results

The _anticipated code structure_ is described in the sections below.

### Offline coupling methods

- One-way internal coupling with 2D mesoscale data f(t,z)
```python
from mmctools.coupling.sowfa import InternalCoupling
to_sowfa = InternalCoupling(output_directory,
                            dataframe_with_driving_data,
                            dateref='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM', # t=0 in simulation
                            datefrom='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM', # output range
                            dateto='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM')
# create internal source terms, f(t,z), from time-height series
to_sowfa.write_timeheight('forcingTable')
# create initial vertical profile, f(z)
to_sowfa.write_ICs('initialValues')
```

- One-way boundary coupling with 4D mesoscale data f(t,x,y,z)
```python
from mmctools.coupling.sowfa import BoundaryCoupling
to_sowfa = BoundaryCoupling(output_directory,
                            xarray_with_driving_data,
                            dateref='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM', # t=0 in simulation
                            datefrom='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM', # output range
                            dateto='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM')
# create inflow planes, e.g., f(t,y,z) or f(t,x,z)
to_sowfa.write_boundarydata()
# create initial field, f(x,y,z)
to_sowfa.write_solution(t=datefrom)
```

### Data processing

- The `dataloaders` module provides tools to download and read datasets from the
  [A2e: Data Archive and Portal (DAP)](https://a2e.energy.gov/about/dap).
  `read_dir()` and `read_date_dirs()` are wrappers around file readers such as
  `pandas.read_csv()`, a measurement-specific reader provided herein, or a
  user-defined reader function. For example:
```python
from mmctools.dataloaders import read_dir
from mmctools.measurements.radar import profiler
# read selected files within a directory and concatenate into dataframe
df = read_dir(dpath, file_filter='*_w*', reader=profiler)
```

- The `measurements.*` modules provide reader functions for meteorological mast
  instruments and remote sensing devices.
  - `measurements.metmast`
  - `measurements.radar`
  - `measurements.lidar`
  - `measurements.sodar`

- The `datawriters` module provides tools to write out data for MMC analysis
  with consistent, *A2e-MMC* standard formats.

- Additional code-specific modules and scripts are also provided (e.g., `wrf.*`)
  where needed.

### Data analysis

- `helper_functions` includes atmospheric science formulae and utility functions
   for converting between quantities of interest

- `plotting` provides routines for visualization in the *A2e-MMC* style


## Installation

To install, run `pip install -e mmctools` after cloning the repository (or `pip install -e .` from inside a2e-mmc/mmctools).


## Code Development Principles

- All code should be usable in, and demonstrated by, Jupyter notebooks.
- All code should be written in Python 3.
- [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines should be
  followed as much as possible.
